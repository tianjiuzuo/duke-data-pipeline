  <h3 class="text-center">Prediction Models</h3>
  <p>Our regular collection of data allows us to build models to predict future trends for domestic violence shelters. For example, we report
    seasonal changes, so that shelters have advance information of when they might expect a surge for their services. Knowing and acting on these trends not only
    helps shelters manage their resources more efficiently, but creates better outcomes for victims as well. We hope to deliver this knowledge at several levels:
    the shelter level, the county level, and the state level.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center">Empirical Research</h3>
  <p>One of the problems that government agencies and domestic violence shelters frequently cite is the lack of real-world data to fully
    understand the domestic violence problem. We hope that through this collection, we are better able to draw conclusions as to what exactly is contributing
    to the growth of this problem. Statistical analysis may show that previously unlinked factors lead to an increase in victimization, or solidify previous
    conclusions so that we are better able to tackle them. This data collection project will serve as the bedrock of that research.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-center">Awareness</h3>
  <p>The data that we collect will be used to generate data visualizations and to provide credibility to awareness-raising campaigns to
    educate the public on the severity of the problem.
